<h1>Hi, I'm Kobi!</h1>
<b>I am an Android and Unity Developer.</b>
</br></br>
I received my B.Sc degree in Computer Science from Bar-Ilan University in 2014. Since then, I have accumulated approximately 9 years of experience in software development, working in the industry at startups and a large company, and also independently as a solo developer.
